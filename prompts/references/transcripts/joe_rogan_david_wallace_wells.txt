Here’s the transcript annotated with speaker labels based on the context, assuming Joe is the host and David is the guest:

David: I think on some level, American policy is a red herring. The US is 15% of global emissions, and we’re falling. The future climate of the world will be determined by China, by India, by sub-Saharan Africa. Those are carbon footprints that are growing. China is now almost twice as big a carbon footprint as the US. And they’re building all this infrastructure outside of China that doesn’t even count in Asia and Africa. You know the Belt and Road?

Joe: Do you know this project?

David: So basically taking the model that the US had with the Suez Canal and the Panama Canal, and they’re building the infrastructure of the developing world. So recently, they loaned Kenya a huge amount of money to build a new rail line, which was being built with Chinese workers. They built the rail line. Then Kenya couldn’t pay back the debt. So China is threatening to take over the entire port of Mombasa as debt repayment. And this is going on all around the world. Highways across Africa, across Asia, are being built by Chinese workers in an effort to build a new imperial infrastructure for themselves.

Joe: And is the thought that they’re doing this in terms of setting up the debt in a way that’s unpayable so that they could take over?

David: That’s one motive. I think that the Kenya example, but they’d be happy if the debt got repaid. They’re stitching together an alternative to the Western infrastructure of trade and transit. They’re basically stitching together an entire second system of how the world will work, how the economy will work, and it will be conducted through their own infrastructure and through their own ports and through their own airports. And that’s being done by their own standards.

David: So China is now pouring more concrete every three years than the US poured in the entire 20th century. And if concrete were a country, it would be the world’s third biggest carbon emitter. So the path of development of these other countries, China, India, and sub-Saharan Africa, are really what’s going to be writing the story of the future.

David: America has a kind of, I think, a moral obligation to lead because historically we had the biggest carbon footprint. But at the moment, we’re a relatively small part of the problem. And within the US, market forces are making a lot of progress for us.

Joe: So the real issue is, how do we figure out a new geopolitics that forces countries like China to act better?

David: And one answer may be as weird as it is to say that Xi Jinping is basically a dictator. If he wants to impose new standards, if he wants to invest aggressively in green energy, he doesn’t have any of the political obstacles that we have in the US. And so there’s a sort of weird sympathy among American climate people for that authoritarianism.

David: And he has, especially since Trump has been elected, been a lot more aggressive talking about climate because he sees if America is not going to be leading, this is an opportunity for China to be like the real face of climate. And that means they’ve invested a ton in solar and wind. They’ve done a lot with air pollution. So Beijing used to be really awful. In 2013, more than a million Chinese people died of air pollution. And now that’s much better.

Joe: What have they done?

David: Just imposing stricter standards on pollution.

Joe: So emissions, coal plants, things like that?

David: That kind of stuff, yeah. But we think about carbon and the whole problem, I think, a little too much in terms of energy. Energy is just 30% of the global carbon footprint. And it’s the easiest one to solve because wind and solar is actually really cheap now. Most parts of the world is cheaper than dirty energy.

Joe: What’s the majority of the footprint?

David: Well, nothing’s a majority. So there’s energy, there’s infrastructure, there’s transportation. And agriculture is a huge underappreciated part of it. It’s something like 30% of the global footprint.

Joe: Is it because of tractors? Or what is it because of?

David: Everything. Everything. Everything that you need to do to run a farm. I mean, really, everything you need to do to live in the world has some kind of carbon footprint. But if we were able to feed all our cattle seaweed, that would have a big impact.

Joe: But all kinds of crops have carbon footprints.

David: But they would still have to do something to get the seaweed and have the seaweed travel, the seaweed deliver it to these farms.

Joe: Well, you could also do it.

David: You could imagine lab-grown meat having a much smaller carbon footprint. I mean, it should if it proceeds as we expect it will. And like I said before, when you look at each particular threat, you can see reasons for optimism. You can see, oh, we’ll figure it out in this way. We’ll figure it out in that way.

David: But the UN says we need to have all of our global emissions by 2030 to have a chance of averting two degrees of warming, which they call catastrophic warming. And the projects that we need to put into place in those 11 years are just much bigger than I think we’re capable of pulling off.

David: They say the UN says what is necessary is a global mobilization at the level of World War II against climate starting this year, 2019. And there’s just no chance that we’re going to do that anytime soon. I mean, maybe 10 years from now we’ll get there. That may even be optimistic.

David: But the total decarbonization that’s required is we need to totally zero out on carbon by 2050, they say. And I just think a lot of these sectors are much trickier. We could maybe zero out on energy, zero out on carbon when it comes to energy in 15 years if we wanted to.

David: But again, that’s just 30% of the total problem, which is why I think there’s the negative emission stuff the carbon capture is so important because it will allow us to move more slowly than the UN says we need to and still, if it works out, keep the planet relatively stable, relatively livable.

David: But those technologies have been called magical thinking by the journal of nature, which is the biggest scientific journal, writing about this stuff. So it’s sort of a leap of faith to think that they could solve that problem.

Joe: Do you think that we’re dealing with shifts and degrees of perception that it’s things like your book, things like Al Gore’s movie, things like anytime there’s a new story that’s written in The New York Times or in any periodical, we need more of this. It needs to be hammered home to people. It needs to be something that’s a global discussion that accelerates.

David: Totally, and I think that that’s happening.

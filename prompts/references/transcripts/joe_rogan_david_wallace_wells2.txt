Here’s the transcript annotated with speaker labels based on the context, assuming Joe is the host and David is the guest:

Joe: One of the problems with climate change is that human beings like to react to things that are immediate and right in front of them. And I think for us it’s very difficult to see the future, especially if it’s inconvenient, especially if it does something to inconvenience or get in the way of our day-to-day routine. And that seems to be what’s happening here, and that seems to me—that seems to me to be why people are so willing to dismiss it so flippantly. Because in front of them right now, it’s not an issue. In front of them right now, this very second, this very day, I’m gonna go to Starbucks. It’s right there. It’s open. Look, I’m outside. 65 degrees out. Global warming is not a problem.

David: Yeah, no, I think that’s—I mean, totally true. And I feel it in my own life. Like, I—I mean, I’ve been working on this material so long. I know it so deeply, and yet when I look out the window, I’m like, you know, things are fine.

Joe: Yeah.

David: And I think that has a really powerful anchoring effect. Like, we expect the world of the future to look like the world as it does today. But all the science says that’s totally naive. And we’re gonna have at least twice as much warming as we’ve had to this point. And I think we need to think about the future of the world in those terms, like what it will be at two degrees, at three degrees, at four degrees.

David: But it’s not just like the immediacy. I think we have so many biases. Like, we want to be optimistic about the future. We have a status quo bias. We don’t want to change things. We think that’ll be complicated and expensive. We have a hard time holding big ideas in our head, like that the entire planet is subject to these forces. I mean, the list goes on and on.

David: In the book, I have a little riff where I say, you know, there’s this new—not so new now—30-40 year discipline in economics, behavioral economics, which is about all of our cognitive biases, how we can’t really see the world. Every single one makes it harder to see climate.

David: There’s this—he’s actually an English professor—named Timothy Morton who wrote a book about climate. He calls it a “hyperobject,” which is like, it’s a phenomenon that’s so big that we can’t actually hold it in our heads at once. We can only see it—it’s like if you imagine seeing a four-dimensional object in three-dimensional space. It’s that kind of thing where you can only see it at an angle, only partially.

David: Climate change is so all-encompassing that we can’t comprehend it properly. But I think that’s—all of those things are reasons that we need to be listening to the scientists and what they’re projecting.

David: Not to say that everything they’re saying is going to come true, will come true exactly as they predict it. Obviously, that’s not how science works. It gets revised. Some things are alarmist. Some things are extreme. Some things are just wrong.

David: But, you know, I’ve been really working on this stuff for a couple years, and the number of papers I’ve read that show—that make me have a more optimistic idea about the future of climate, I could count on two hands. And the number of papers I’ve read that make me have a bleak view of the future? It’s in the thousands.

David: And when you look at the totality of that, whether the six climate-driven natural disasters prediction is gonna pan out exactly as those authors say, who knows? But when you see, you know, so many terrifying studies that you could fill—I did a 300-page book with them—you realize that, like, there’s a huge margin for error, and it would, like, we would still be really in bad shape, you know?

Joe: Is there—I mean, I’m sure there have been some studies that made mistakes in terms of, like, past studies that projected that by now we’d all be dead. Are those—those seem to be a problem with this whole concept we have of wrapping our head around it. And if we find anything that we could point to that say, “Oh, back in the ‘80s, they said we’d all be dead by now, and we’re fine, we’re gonna be fine,” that kind of thing—is that—that is an issue, correct?

David: Totally.

David: Yeah, there was a really famous book in the middle of the 20th century called The Population Bomb. So this is a guy named Paul Ehrlich, who—he was like, “You know, the world just cannot support this many people. Like, if we get to 8 billion people, there just won’t be enough food, there won’t be—you know, the planet can’t sustain that.”

David: And he’s often pointed to as this sort of, like, prophet of doomsday. And his prophecy totally didn’t work out because we had this thing that’s called the Green Revolution. Basically, we figured out ways to make crops way, way, way more productive.

Joe: And that’s encouraging. Human civilization does that a lot—we figure our way out of foxholes all the time.

David: Yeah. But that revolution was literally like one dude—Norman Borlaug—who figured out how to grow crops differently.

Joe: One guy?

David: One guy. One set of innovations, and he completely transformed the whole fate of the planet.

Joe: What did he do?

David: He just basically did, like, genetically modified crops before, like, the—you know, before the name.

Joe: He’s the golden rice guy?

David: Yeah.

David: And, you know, the whole developing world benefited enormously. And you’re still seeing that today. Like, we see all these charts—so much less poverty, so much less infant mortality in the developing world. And that’s great. That’s, like, incredible progress. But a lot of that was powered by the industrialization of those countries.
